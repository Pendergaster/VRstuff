# **Course project**

This engine is done as part of the school course. Project provides virtual reality rendering with oculus. 
VR rendering was done with (Ovr library provided by Oculus)[https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/pc/pcsdk-intro/], with OpenGL rendering.
I used C++ as programming language and project is build as unity build.
Engine has also integrated [3D Bullet physics engine](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) and animation pipeline.
User is able to walk around the scene using oculus controllers.
